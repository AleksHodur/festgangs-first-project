# FestGangs

FestGangs is an app made to reunite people who want to attend to the same concert in small groups.

# A project from some time ago

This is the first attempt to create this app which I created while I was learning web development, so it is a bit outdated. It has Node with MySql on the back and Javascript on the front with Bootstrap for the design. Now I'm developing a newer version using MERN stack; it's still "under construction", but you can check it on my profile.

However, I'm still proud of what I've done for this project and I still want to show it, even though now I have more experience and I want to think I write better code :)

# Try it yourself

Installation of node, npm and MySQL needed.

Use command `npm install` to install all node_modules described in the package.json file.

Run `node db` to create the sample database.

Command `node app` to run the application.

Tap `localhost:3000` on your browser and you're done :)
